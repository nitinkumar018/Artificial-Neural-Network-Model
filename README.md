## The dataset provided, "Alphabets_data.csv", consists of labeled data suitable for a classification task aimed at identifying different alphabets
## Classification Using Artificial Neural Networks with Hyperparameter Tuning on Alphabets Data
## Begin by loading and exploring the "Alphabets_data.csv" dataset. Summarize its key features such as the number of samples, features, and classes.
## Construct a basic ANN model using your chosen high-level neural network library. Ensure your model includes at least one hidden layer
## Train your model on the training set and then use it to make predictions on the test set.
## Hyperparameters, such as the number of hidden layers, neurons per hidden layer, activation function to observe their impact on model performance.
## TensorFlow, Keras
